### INSTALLATION GUIDE ###

- Download ConfID.zip and unpack all files to your directory of choice.

- ConfID requires Python distributions to be used and it is optimized for Python 2.7, but also compatible with Python 3.x.

- Open a terminal in the working directory and type:

	$ python check_dep.py

- This will check for all python libraries required to run ConfID. Usually, 
ConfID requires the following external libraries:

	-> graphviz
	-> matplotlib
	-> numpy

- If any of those are missing, you should install it before continuing.


### ALIASING CONFID ###

- In order to run ConfID in any given directory without carrying a lot of files 
with you, we strongly advise you to alias ConfID.

- For this, copy the "ConfID" folder that was extracted before;

- Move it to an installation folder of your choice;

- Then, add the following line to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:

	alias confID='python /installation_folder_you_chose/ConfID/confID.py'

	(example: alias confID='python /home/marcelo/Tools/ConfID/confID.py)

- Then run on terminal:

	$ source ~/.bashrc

- After this, you should be able to run ConfID in your terminal at any given 
directory by simple typing:

	$ confID input.inp config
