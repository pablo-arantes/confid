### INSTALLATION GUIDE ###

- ConfID requires Python distributions to be used. It works with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.

- Download ConfID.zip from the github page (https://github.com/sbcblab/confid) and unpack all files to your directory of choice.

- Open a terminal in the working directory and type:

	$ python check_dep.py

- This will check for all python libraries required to run ConfID. Usually, ConfID requires the following external libraries:

	-> graphviz (https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/)
	-> matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
	-> numpy (https://numpy.org/)

- If any of those are missing, you should install it before continuing. Please note that graphviz and matplotlib are only required if you intend to use the ConfID built-in plot capabilities.

- NOTE ABOUT GRAPHVIZ:
Before installing Graphviz for Python, make sure that the original software is installed (http://www.graphviz.org/download/). Before installing it, the following dependencies should be installed as well:
$ sudo apt install -y libgd-dev
$ sudo apt install -y fontconfig
$ sudo apt install -y libcairo2-dev
$ sudo apt install -y libpango1.0-dev
$ sudo apt install -y libgts-dev

### ALIASING CONFID ###

- In order to run ConfID in any given directory without carrying a lot of files with you, we strongly advise you to alias ConfID.

- For this, copy the "ConfID" folder that was extracted before;

- Move it to an installation folder of your choice;

- Then, add the following line to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:

	alias confID='python /installation_folder_you_chose/ConfID/confID.py'

	Example: alias confID='python /home/youruser/Tools/ConfID/confID.py

- Then run on terminal:

	$ source ~/.bashrc

- After this, you should be able to run ConfID in your terminal at any given directory simple by typing:

	$ confID input.inp config
